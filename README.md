A 6-stage pipelined RISC processor designed as a part of the EE309-Microprocessors course at EE, IIT Bombay. The design has been implemented using VHDL. Quartus and Altera Modelsim were used to design, debug and test the whole project. The VHDL code was ultimately synthesized on a Terasic DE0-Nano board with the Altera Cyclone IV 4C22 FPGA.

Detailed description of the processor ISA, various operations, its operands, destination, flags modified by it, etc., can be found at
